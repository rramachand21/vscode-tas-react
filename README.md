# Getting Started

This application is a canonical React application generated with `create-react-app`. The client code is under the `client` folder. The server code is in `index.js`.

## Getting the Code

Clone directly from GitHub or from your Try Azure App Service instance.

## Running the Application Locally

After cloning, install the necessary npm dependencies for both client and server:

```
> npm install
> cd client
> npm install
```

Next, start the front-end development server and back-end API server. From the project root:

```
> npm start
```

You now have a front-end development server running on port 3000. The Express API is running on port 3001. Webpack takes care of proxying requests from the front-end development server to your API server as needed.

## Deployment

### Production Build

```
> npm run build
```

You may want to prune both the root and the client packages:

```
> npm prune --production && cd client && npm prune --production
```

### Deploying to Azure
